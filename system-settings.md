1. `Abbreviated Name` - Will be name displayed on the top banner for smaller screens like mobile.

## Expected Monthly Contributions

!> **Caution** It is important that the administrator accurately records all `Expected Monthly Contribution` date ranges with no overlaps or gaps so that arrears and dues can be calculated correctly.

The Expected monthly contribtions section enables to administrator to set  the data ranges and corresponding amounts for the date ranges that the system expects savings contributions from each dues paying member. The ranges are used to determine each members expected contribution and to calculate arrears. Comparing with each member's [participation dates](member-accounts.md?id=participation-dates), the system knows how much to expect every month.

### System will track arrears

This is a master button to set whether or not the club will track arrears. If this is turned off, then no date ranges are expected and it is assumed that there is no required amount that the club expects from members.

### Date Range Table

If the system has been set to track arrears the administrator will use this table to add, delete and maintain the range of dates and how much is expected for each active member.
