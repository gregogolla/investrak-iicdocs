For a new Loan record to be created and processed there is a workflow in place which must usually be followed. 

1. **`APPLICATION`** - The applicaant creates the application and submits it.
2. **`APPROVAL`** - Approvers review and approve the application
3. **`DISBURSAL`** - The [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) marks the loan as **Disbursed** once funds have been distributed to the applicant.
