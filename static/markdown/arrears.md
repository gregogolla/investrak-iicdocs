>For the arrears module to be visible, the system must have the [**`TRACK ARREARS`**](17_admin_system-settings?id=_1714-system-will-track-arrears) setting turned on.  

If the [`TRACK ARREARS`](17_admin_system-settings?id=_1714-system-will-track-arrears) setting is turned on, the system automatically calculates and tracks how much each club member is supposed to pay every month. The expected amount is compared to the total amount that the member has contributed and if it is less, then the club member is in arrears.
