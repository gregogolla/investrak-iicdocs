Some Investment Clubs may want to keep track of their members' [**`EMPLOYMENT DETAILS`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1025-employment-details).

If the [**`Profile will include Employment Details`**](17_admin_system-settings?id=profile-will-include-employment-details) setting is enabled, the system will add controls that can be used to record the members' [**`EMPLOYMENT DETAILS`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1025-employment-details) information. 

This enables the Investment Club to maintain a comprehensive record of the members' employment details, facilitating better understanding and management of the members' profiles.
