Usually, the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) is responsible for entering all transactions into the platform. This means that whenever Club members make Savings contributions payments directly to the Bank  the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) will need to be informed so as to update the records. The **`SELF SUBMIT SAVINGS`** feature is intended to lighten the workload by enabling the Club members to submit the details of their own Savings contribution payments onto the platform for review.

If the [**`SELF SUBMIT SAVINGS`**](17_admin_system-settings?id=self-submit-savings) setting is turned on, the self submit controls will be enabled on the [**`SAVINGS`**](05_user_savings) module. Individual club members can then enter the details of their submitted savings contributions into the platform with supporting attachments (receipt, bank slip etc). 

There is a workflow in place that notifies the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) who then uses the self submit controls in the [**`MANAGE SAVINGS`**](13_admin_manage-savings) module to review and approve  the submitted Savings contribution payments. Once the payments are approved, they are added into the ledger and reflected against the Member's Savings account.
