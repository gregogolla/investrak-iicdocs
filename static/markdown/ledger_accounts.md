### LEDGER ACCOUNTS EXPLAINED

 The Investment club's transactions are managed in a ledger, which is a collection of accounts to store and manage financial data. All financial transactions are recorded into the system as a double entry ledger, once as a debit and once as a credit. This ensures that the total debits always equal the total credits, and provides a balanced view of the Investment club's finances; this is a fundamental principle of accounting practice.
 
 To be able to store transactions and report on them, the application groups all transactions into five well known accounting categories: assets, liabilities, equity, expenses and revenue. These accounts are managed through the [`Finance Accounts Module`](/14_admin_finance-accounts)

**`ASSETS:`**
Represent the resources that the club owns, like cash, inventory, equipment, and property. All transactions reflecting assets will be recorded with an account under this category.

**`LIABILITIES:`**
Represent debts or money owed by the club, such as member savings held by the club, accounts payable, and Taxes owed. All transactions reflecting liabilities will be recorded with an account under this category.

**`EQUITY:`**
Represents the ownership stake in the club, calculated by subtracting liabilities from assets. All transactions reflecting equity will be recorded  with an account under this category.

**`EXPENSES:`**
Represents costs incurred during club operations, like salaries, rent, and utilities. All transactions reflecting expenditure will be recorded with an account under this category.  

**`REVENUE:`**
Represents income generated from selling goods or services. All transactions reflecting revenue will be recorded with an account under this category.
