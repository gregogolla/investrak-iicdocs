Some Investment Clubs may want to keep track of their members' [**`Next of Kin`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1026-next-of-kin-details) details. 

If the [**`Profile will include Next of Kin`**](17_admin_system-settings?id=profile-will-include-next-of-kin) setting is enabled, the system will add fields that can be used to record the members' [**`Next of Kin`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1026-next-of-kin-details) information. 

This will enable the Investment Club to maintain detailed and accurate information about the members' next of kin, ensuring preparedness for emergencies, beneficiaries, or important communications.
