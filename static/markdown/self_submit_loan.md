Usually, the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) is responsible for entering all transactions into the platform. This means that whenever Club members make loan payments directly to the Bank  the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) will need to be informed so as to update the records. The **`SELF SUBMIT LOAN PAYMENTS`** feature is intended to lighten the workload by enabling the Club members to submit the details of their own loan payments onto the platform for review.

If the [**`SELF SUBMIT LOAN PAYMENTS`**](17_admin_system-settings?id=self-submit-loan-payments) setting is turned on, the self submit controls will be enabled on the [**`LOANS`**](05_user_loans) module. Individual club members can then enter the details of their submitted loan payments into the platform with supporting attachments (receipt, bank slip etc). 

There is a workflow in place that notifies the [**`TREASURER`**](10_admin_member-accounts?id=_1034-treasurer-group) who then uses the self submit controls in the [**`MANAGE LOANS`**](13_admin_manage-loans) module to review and approve the submitted loan payments. Once the payments are approved, they are added into the ledger and reflected against the Member's loan.
