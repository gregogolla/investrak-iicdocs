Some Investment Clubs may require members to be recommended by an existing member. If the [**`Profile will include Recommenders`**](static/markdown/recommenders.md ':include') setting is enabled, the system will add the mechanism to track recommenders for each profile. This will help Investment Clubs ensure accountability and maintain a clear record of recommendations, enabling trust and transparency in the membership process. 

Recommenders are selected from a drop down field of existing members.
