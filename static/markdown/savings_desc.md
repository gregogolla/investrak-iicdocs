Savings contributions from members are the primary vehicle through which the Investment club is collectively funded. The **`SAVINGS MODULE`** is used to display and track the details of member's savings contributions. It provides the following capabilities:
- Members can track a chronological record of their savings transactions.
- Members can review detailed entries such as savings contributions, withdrawals, and transfers(where applicable).
- It provides a search mechanism to filter for specific dates, memos or transaction types for easier analysis.
