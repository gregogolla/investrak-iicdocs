### Activate or disable Users
To login and use the platform a user's login needs to be active. All user accounts have one of the following statuses:

  - `Active` - This is the status that all members who login to the system will normally have. The status is denoted by the colour green.
  - `Pending` - When a member initially registers into the system the user's account is saved with this status. They will be unable to login until the administrator changes the status to `Active`. The admin cannot manually set an account to this status. The status is denoted by the colour orange.
  - `Disabled` - When a user leaves the investment club, the Administrator can disable the user's login by changing the status to `Disabled`. The member will be unable to login until the administrator changes the status to `Active`. The status is denoted by the colour red.

## Accounts
All paying members of the fund should be associated with an account. An account is the entity to which savings contributions, loans, and loan payments to or from the fund are attributed to. An account can contain one or more users. Although expected contributions depend on each individual in an account, the amounts are reflected against the account.
