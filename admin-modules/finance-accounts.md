To be able to store transactions and report on them, the systm groups all transactions into several Financial accounts. These accounts are largely grouped into the following categories:

- `Assets` - to record transactions for any physical items of value that the club owns
- `Liabilities` - to record transactions on debts that the club owes
- `Equity` - to record share capital, dividends and to track what is left after subtracting liabilities from assets
- `Expenses` - to record all of the money and resources the club spends for operations or in the process of generating revenues
- `Revenue` - keep track of any income the club brings in from operations
