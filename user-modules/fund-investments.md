### Investment FUNDING
 `Investment FUNDING` is the cumulative sum of money that has been used to fund the Investment. Any external money that is put into the Investment (e.g. Deposit from Bank), will increase the `Investment FUNDING` amount. Any money withdrawn from the Investment (e.g. Transfer to Bank), will decrease the `Investment FUNDING` amount.

 ### Investment RETURNS
 `Investment RETURNS` is the money that has been made or lost from the Investment. Any income that is derived from the Investment (e.g. interest, dividends and capital gains) will increase the `Investment RETURNS` amount. Any loss (e.g. fees, taxes or capital loss) will decrease the `Investment RETURNS` amount.

 ### Investment VALUE
 `Investment VALUE` is the total value of the Investment at any given time. It is the combination of the `Investment FUNDING` (taking into account deposits and withdrawals) and `Investment RETURNS` (taking into account gains, losses, taxes and fees).

 ## Investment Transactions
 Investment Transactions can be found in the `Edit Investment` page of each Investment record. They provide a way to granularly track the transactions for deposits, withdrwals, gains, losses, taxes and fees associated with the Investment.
