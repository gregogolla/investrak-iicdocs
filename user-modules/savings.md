## Self Submit Savings

If permitted by the Club Administrator or Treasurer, regular club members can record their own savings that they have submitted to the bank. There is a workflow in place so that the Treasurer will be notified and will need to approve before the submitted is added into the account savings.

Follow these steps to make a submission:

1. From the savings page navigate to the `SELF SUBMITTED SAVINGS` tab and click on the 3 vertical dots menu.
