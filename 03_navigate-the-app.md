## THE NAVIGATION MENUS
The navigation menu helps you to intuitively and easily navigate  the applications  through the the different pages and find the relevant content. The menus are grouped into links with similar content - like user related resources (`My Savings` and `My Loans`) vs club related resources (like `Fund Activity` or `Fund Investments`). The groups of menus can be expanded to show the menu links under them or collapsed to reduce clutter.
