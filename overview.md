# Navigating the Application
![alt text](images/2.1_App_Overview.png "App Overview")

The Application is built to allow easy access of all the screens and content using Navigation menus, the Top Banner area, and the  Main Content Page. After successfully logging in, these sections will be displayed.


## The Top Banner Area
 The top banner on the screen will display some additional icons and information. It displays additional menus to help the user navigate easier and a [User profile drop-down](top-banner.md#user-drop-down) that allows you as the user to [manage  your password](top-banner.md#change-password), [manage your own profile](top-banner.md#member-profile) and also to [log off](top-banner.md#log-out) from the site.

## The Navigation Menus
The navigation menu helps you to intuitively and easily navigate  the applications  through the the different pages and find the relevant content. The menus are grouped into links with similar content - like dashboards or finances and the groups of menus can be expanded to show the menu links under them or collapsed to reduce clutter.

## The Main Content Area
The main content area is a dynamic page area that is used to display the data that you have selected using the navigation menus or links from the top banner. This is the page that will show you the important content on the site.
