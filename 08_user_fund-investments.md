### Investment FUNDING
 **`Investment FUNDING`** is the cumulative sum of money that has been used to fund the Investment. Any external money that is put into the Investment (e.g. Deposit from Bank), will increase the `Investment FUNDING` amount. Any money withdrawn from the Investment (e.g. Transfer to Bank), will decrease the `Investment FUNDING` amount.

### Investment GAINS
 **`Investment GAINS`** is the money that has been made or lost from the Investment. 
 Any income that is derived from the Investment (e.g. interest, dividends and 
 capital gains) will increase the `Investment RETURNS` amount. 
 Any loss (e.g. fees, taxes or capital loss) will decrease the `Investment RETURNS` 
 amount.

### Investment DEBITS
**`Investment DEBITS`** is the money that has been withdrawn from the Investment.

### Investment VALUE
**`Investment VALUE`** is the total value of the Investment at any given time. 
It is the combination of the `Investment FUNDING` (taking into account depositsand  
withdrawals) and `Investment GAINS` (taking into account gains, losses, taxes and fees).
